<p>Time just dissolves into quick-moving particles that are swirling away. Either I'm moving fast or time is. Never both simultaneously.</p>
<p>It's such a strange paradox. I mean, while, technically, I'm closer to the end of my life than I've ever been, I actually feel more than ever that I have all the time in the world. When I was younger, there was a desperation, a desire for certainty, like there was an end to the path, and I had to get there.</p>
<p>I know what you mean, because I can remember thinking, &quot;Oh, someday, like in my mid-thirties maybe, everything's going to just somehow gel and settle, just end.&quot; It was like there was this plateau, and it was waiting for me, and I was climbing up it, and when I got to the top, all growth and change would stop. Even exhilaration. But that hasn't happened like that, thank goodness. I think that what we don't take into account when we're young is our endless curiosity. That's what's so great about being human.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah. Well do you know that thing Benedict Anderson says about identity?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Well, he's talking about like, say, a baby picture. So you pick up this picture, this two-dimensional image, and you say, &quot;That's me.&quot; Well, to connect this baby in this weird little image with yourself living and breathing in the present, you have to make up a story like, &quot;This was me when I was a year old, and then later I had long hair, and then we moved to Riverdale, and now here I am.&quot; So it takes a story that's actually a fiction to make you and the baby in the picture identical to create your identity.</p>
<p>And the funny thing is, our cells are completely regenerating every seven years. We've already become completely different people several times over, and yet we always remain quintessentially ourselves.</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
