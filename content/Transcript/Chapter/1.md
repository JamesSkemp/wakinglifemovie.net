<p>(The Tosca Tango orchestra is rehearsing in a house)</p>
<p>Rock out. Rock and roll. Go strings. Dig in. Sara, will you try that, the thing you asked me about?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Will you try it a little more subdued?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Vibrato. Just try it and see what you think. But what I want - I mean, I want it to sound rich and maybe almost a little wavy due to being slightly out of tune.</p>
<p>Do you want it, um -</p>
<p>I think it should be slightly detached.</p>
<p>That's what I was wondering.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, you got it.</p>
<p>Okay, pick up to 20, please.</p>
<p>Erik, this is a pickup to 20.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>1, 2, 3.</p>
