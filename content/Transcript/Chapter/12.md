## Chapter 12 - Society Is a Fraud

<p>(Four guys are walking down the street. They take turns talking)</p>
<p><a href="http://media.jamesrskemp.com/graphics/wakingLife/WakingLife_12_1.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;"><img src="http://media.jamesrskemp.com/graphics/wakingLife/WakingLife_12_1_t.jpg" alt="Waking Life: Chapter 12 - Society Is a Fraud" style="width:250px;height:140px;" align="right" /></a>If the world that we are forced to accept is false and nothing is true, then everything is possible.</p>
<p>On the way to discovering what we love, we will find everything we hate, everything that blocks our path of what we desire.</p>
<p>The comfort will never be comfortable for those who seek what is not on the market.</p>
<p>A systematic questioning of the idea of happiness.</p>
<p>We'll cut the vocal chords of every empowered speaker. We'll yank the social symbols through the looking glass We'll devalue society's currency.</p>
<p>To confront the familiar.</p>
<p>Society is a fraud so complete and venal that it demands to be destroyed beyond the power of memory to recall its existence.</p>
<p>Where there is fire, we will carry gasoline.</p>
<p>To interrupt the continuum of everyday experience and all the normal expectations that go with it.</p>
<p>To live as if something actually depended on one's actions.</p>
<p>To rupture the spell of the ideology of the commodified consumer society so that our repressed desires of a more authentic nature can come forward.</p>
<p>To demonstrate the contrast between what life presently is and what it could be.</p>
<p>To immerse ourselves in the oblivion of actions and know we're making it happen.</p>
<p>There will be an intensity never before known in everyday life to exchange love and hate, life and death, terror and redemption, repulsions and attractions.</p>
<p>An affirmation of freedom so reckless and unqualified, that it amounts to a total denial of every kind of restraint and limitation.</p>

<p>(The same four guys see an old man up on a telephone pole.)</p>
<p>Hey, old man, what you doin' up there?</p>
<p>Well, I'm not sure.</p>
<p>You need any help getting down, sir?</p>
<p>No, don't think so.</p>
<p>Stupid bastard.</p>
<p>No worse than us. He's all action and no theory. We're all theory and no action.</p>

<p>(The same four guys see an old man sitting at a bench)</p>
<p>Why so glum, Mr. Debord?</p>
<p>What was missing was felt irretrievable. The extreme uncertainties of subsisting without working made excesses necessary and breaks definitive. To quote Stevenson: &quot;Suicide carried off many. Drink and the devil took care of the rest.&quot;</p>
